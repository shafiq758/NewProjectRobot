Guidelines for adding automation test cases
-------------------------------------------
Please follow these guidelines when writing new automation test cases:

1. Automation test cases must align with test cases on Test Rail. To do this, make sure the followings are in place
   a. "Type" header on TestRail needs to change to "Automated" when it has been automated.
   b. Add Tags in robot test cases to indicate test case number. e.g.[Tags]  C3068
2. All test cases file need to be placed in "tests-qa" folder
3. Do not modify any other file or folder as it may break our daily auto testing process. 
4. Need to follow Gemini develop flow for submitting PR: 
   a. Create ticket on JIRA
   b. Create branch in the ticket and start working on that branch
   c. Commit with changes
   d. Create PR and assign reviewer for merging.
   e. Close the ticket after merge is done.
